# Description

This is my first full-stack personal project that follows the completion of my software engineering bootcamp with General Assembly.
I built an e-commerce website, fully responsive, whose design is inspired by Amazon.
The users of this website can:
- Sign in/sign up using an authentication system and have access to gated functionalities.
- Filter and view products including detailed description, images, customer reviews.
- Sell products, using a drag and drop feature for uploading images.
- See and manage their orders, post product reviews.
- Add and remove products to their basket and proceed to a Stripe payment.
- Manage their whishlist.
